// Internal class for tracking retries for a given FBRequestConnection
//   Essentially this helps FBRequestConnection support a two phase approach
//   to processing its request handlers. The first pass is the normal
//   loop over the request handlers. The handlers then have the opportunity
//   to passage messages to this RetryManager (typically `addRequestMetadata`
//   to queue a request for the second phase, or update the state for more complex
//   scenarios like repairing a session).
// Then the second phase executes and will eventually (possibly after an
//   attempt to repair the session) invoke the queued handlers.
// Thus, this class has the unfortunate responsibility of keeping state
//   between handlers.
